Components:

1. Improvements

1.1.	Better scripts for your characters (Beta) (BG1EE, BG2EE, IWD1EE)
	- The Advanced AI script now causes your characters to stay with an opponent instead of attacking for only one turn.
	- Thieves, shamans and monks automatically search for traps and illusions
	- Shamans automatically perform the shaman dance in combat
	- Bards automatically always sing
	- Stalkers automatically hide
	- These changes also affect the scripts "Standard Attack", "Thief Disposal" and "Bard Controlled".
	- This means that "Bard Controlled" and your WASD control no longer overlap.

1.2. Zeke is now silent (Makes no sense in English) (BG1EE)

1.3. Valygar is no longer annoying when he is hiding (BG2EE)
	-Valygar always said the same sentence when he was hiding. Since he does this very often as a stalker, I quickly found this phrase annoying. With this option, he no longer says the sentence out loud.

1.4. No "You must gather your party before venturing forth"-sound more (BG1EE, BG2EE)
	- This function also exists in other mods, but only with this option did it work for me

1.5. Ursa now attacks the player (BG1EE)
	- Ursa no longer attacks Nexlit, instead it attacks the player.

1.6. Knott reacts to the fight in front of the tent (BG1EE)
	- Knott now becomes aggressive when the player has fought in front of the tent.

1.7. Aldeth hunters join in the fight (BG1EE)
	- The hunters of Aldeth in the first Mantle Forest area now join the fight against you. This was sometimes not the case.

1.10 Previous increases in wisdom are taken into account in Anomen's test (BG2EE)
	- When Anomen's examination is positive, his wisdom is no longer set at 16 but increased by 4. This makes it possible to permanently increase it by one before the examination so that he has a wisdom of 17 after the examination.
